Syntastic is a syntax checking plugin that runs buffers through external syntax
checkers as they are saved and opened. If syntax errors are detected, the user
is notified and is happy because they didn't have to compile their code or
execute their script to find them.

The following functionality is provided and must be enabled/activated as
indicated in the help file:
    * A statusline flag appears when syntax errors are detected
    * |signs| are placed beside lines with syntax errors, where a different
      sign is used for errors and warnings.
    * The :Errors command is provided to open a |location-list| for
      the syntax errors in the current buffer

Syntastic comes in two parts: the syntax checker plugins, and the core script
(i.e. syntastic.vim). The syntax checker plugins are defined on a per-filetype
basis where each one wraps up an external syntax checking program. The core
script delegates off to these plugins and uses their output to provide the
syntastic functionality. Currently, syntax checking plugins exist for eruby,
haml, html, javascript, php, python, ruby and sass.

If your language is not supported then see |syntastic-syntax-checkers| for
details on how to implement a syntax checking plugin, and be sure to send me a
patch ;-)

This plugin is currently only recommended for *nix users. It is functional on
Windows, but since the syntax checking plugins shell out, the command window
briefly appears whenever one is executed.
