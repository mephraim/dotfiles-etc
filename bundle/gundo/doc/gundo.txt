Making's Vim's undo tree usable by humans.

==============================================================================
1. Intro                                                *Gundo-plugin* *Gundo*

You know that Vim lets you undo changes like any text editor. What you might
not know is that it doesn't just keep a list of your changes -- it keeps
a goddamed |:undo-tree| of them.

Say you make a change (call it X), undo that change, and then make another
change (call it Y). With most editors, change X is now gone forever. With Vim
you can get it back.

The problem is that trying to do this in the real world is painful. Vim gives
you an |:undolist| command that shows you the leaves of the tree. Good luck
finding the change you want in that list.

Gundo is a plugin to make browsing this ridiculously powerful undo tree less
painful.

2. Usage                                                          *GundoUsage*

We'll get to the technical details later, but if you're a human the first
thing you need to do is add a mapping to your |:vimrc| to toggle the undo
graph: >

    nnoremap <F5> :GundoToggle<CR>

Change the mapped key to suit your taste. We'll stick with F5 because that's
what the author uses.

Now you can press F5 to toggle the undo graph and preview pane, which will
look something like this: >

      Preview pane

Your current position in the undo tree is marked with an '@' character. Other
nodes are marked with an 'o' character.

When you toggle open the graph Gundo will put your cursor on your current
position in the tree. You can move up and down the graph with the j and
k keys.

You can move to the top of the graph (the newest state) with gg and to the
bottom of the graph (the oldest state) with G.

As you move between undo states the preview pane will show you a unified diff
of the change that state made.

Pressing enter on a state will revert the contents of the file to match that
state.

Pressing P while on a state will initiate "play to" mode targeted at that
state. This will replay all the changes between your current state and the
target, with a slight pause after each change. It's mostly useless, but can be
fun to watch and see where your editing lags -- that might be a good place to
define a new mapping to speed up your editing.

Pressing q while in the undo graph will close it.  You can also just press your
toggle mapping key.

6. Credits                                                      *GundoCredits*

The graphing code was all taken from Mercurial, hence the GPLv2+ license.

The plugin was heavily inspired by histwin.vim, and the code for scratch.vim
helped the author get started.
